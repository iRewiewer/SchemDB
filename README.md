## SchemDB – Mod-aware Minecraft Schematic Viewer & Library

SchemDB is a Windows desktop application designed to act as both a viewer and a local databank/library for Minecraft schematics (.schem / .schematic), with first-class support for modded schematics.

The goal is not to perfectly re-render Minecraft visuals, but to provide:
- fast visual previews,
- clear detection of which mods are required,
- clean organization and metadata,
- and a simple, extensible way to customize how blocks look.

The app is intended to be built with Electron + Three.js, but the concept is framework-agnostic.
